[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:37 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findwarehouse_ros_sqlite.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "warehouse_ros_sqlite", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "warehouse_ros_sqlite" with any of the following names:

    warehouse_ros_sqliteConfig.cmake
    warehouse_ros_sqlite-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "warehouse_ros_sqlite" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "warehouse_ros_sqlite_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "warehouse_ros_sqlite" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
